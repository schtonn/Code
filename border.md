# Border

Is there a border we will never cross? Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try? It turns out, there are. Even with sci-fi technology, we are trapped in a limited pocket of the universe and the finite stuff within it.

If you look at the night sky, you might assume it will be there forever. Stars are born and die again in a cycle that feels endless. But it's not. Take the Milky Way: Up to 200,000 light years in diameter（直径）, containing 100 to 400 billion stars. How many stars do you think are born here each year? Thousands? Millions? The answer is around three. Three new stars per year. 95% of all the stars that will ever exist in the universe have already been born, and we live at the tail end of the age of star formation（形成）. We are at the beginning of the end of the universe as we know it, the formation of new stars will continue to slow down.

But there's more. It turns out that the universe is rushing away from us. The Milky Way is not alone - together with the Andromeda galaxy（仙女座星系）, and more than fifty dwarf galaxies, it forms the Local Group（本星系群）, a region of space about ten million light years in diameter, our galactic neighbourhood. Hundreds of galaxy groups like the Local Group make up the Laniakea Supercluster（拉尼亚凯亚超星系团）, which itself is only one of a myriad of superclusters. In total, there are around two trillion galaxies that make up the current observable universe. Unfortunately, even if we could travel at light speed, around 94% of the galaxies we can see are already unreachable for us forever.

The universe is expanding（扩张） faster and faster, this expansion means that there is a cosmological horizon（宇宙的边界） around us. Everything beyond it is travelling faster, relative to us, than the speed of light. So everything that passes the horizon, is irretrievably out of reach forever, and we will never be able to interact with it again. In a sense it's like a black hole's event horizon, but all around us. 94% of the galaxies we can see today have already passed it and are lost to us forever. All the pockets of the Local Group will one day pass our cosmological horizon. Once they do, their light won't be able to reach us anymore, and from our perspective, they will fade away into darkness.

Once this happens, no information outside of the Local Group will reach us ever again. The universe will **recede** from view. A being born in the far future will think that the universe contains of nothing but its own galaxy. When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They may have no way of knowing what we know today: the nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end.
