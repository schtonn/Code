From my perspective, the cancellation of the P.E. exam is not a good sign. It shows how our education system manipulates fairness and justice, and how this is just unfair.

To us students, the Ministry of Education holds so much power, that it decides our fate in a piece of decree. We work hard to get to the goal it sets for us, but then the prizes are taken away. Upon this cancellation, those who work hard are disregarded, and the lazy ones are given full mark. I'm not saying that this initiative is incorrect, but the Ministry decides on its own, in a word this is tyranny. There will be happy ones, lost ones and gloating ones, but we are ignoring a fact: Despite we are in a democratic society, we still have no power in our education system.

There has to be a change. Students should have a concrete way of influencing the Ministry of Education.
