If you understood the fallacy, please write down your own version of examples for the 4 conditions (*You may skip*).

1. The former caused the latter:

&nbsp;

2. Correlated by coincidence:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

3. Latter caused former:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

4. Common underlying cause:

1. In 1843, the childbed fever is killing women after they give birth, and nobody knows what causes it.
An obstetrician named Charles Meigs has a theory. He pointed out that the patients who has abdominal inflammation will tend to develop the fever and claims that the inflammation causes the fever.

2. What do you think about it?

   Meigs’ argument is based on a fallacy – the false cause fallacy.

   What you need to understand is: correlation does not imply causation.
3. When two phenomena regularly occur together:
   - The former caused the latter.
   - It is possible that they are correlated by coincidence.
   - The causation might be opposite, the latter causing the former.
   - Both could share a common underlying cause.

4. Now we will find some examples to prove the statement above. Try and think of something in your life.
