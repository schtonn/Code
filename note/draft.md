## The biggest river on Earth
### 原文

`1` The Amazon River in South America is thought to be the second longest river in the world after the Nile River in Africa. However, the Amazon is definitely the biggest river in the world by volume. It flows through the thick jungles(丛林,密林) of the Amazon Rainforest that covers much of Brazil. At the point where it opens into the sea, the river mouth is about 330 kilometers wide. This number shows that the Amazon is almost as wide at its mouth as the entire length of the Thames River (348 kilometers)in England. Moreover, the Amazon River carries more water than any other river in the world, with a total river flow greater than the next top ten largest rivers flowing into the ocean combined. The Amazon River flows from the Andes Mountains in Peru across northern Brazil to wide delta (三角洲) on the Atlantic Ocean. Many smaller rivers join it along its course).

`2` The river is home to over 3,000 recognized types of fish and the number is still rising. More than one-third of all species in the world inhabit the Amazon Rainforest, including the"Boto", which is known as the Amazon River Dolphin, and the dangerous piranha(水虎鱼), which may attack livestock(家畜) and humans as well.

`3` The Amazon River contains one-fifth of the world's freshwater. And although it is far away from us, it is very important because it drains (使流出) the water from the enormous Amazon Rainforest, which is the largest rainforest in the world. It is this rainforest that helps to **remove** carbon dioxide($\texttt{CO}_{\texttt{2}}$) from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a major cause of **global warming**.
